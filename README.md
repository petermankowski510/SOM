Implementation of Self Organizing Neural Network (SONN) from Scratch
"""Implementation of Self Organizing Neural Network (SONN) from Scratch
author: Peter Mankowski
-Construct a Self Organizing Neural Network (SONN) or Kohonen Network with 100 neurons arranged in a
     2-dimensional matrix with 10 rows and 10 columns
-Train the network with 1500 2-dimensional input vectors randomly generated in the interval between -1 and +1
-Select initial synaptic weights randomly in the same interval -1 and +1
-Assign learning rate parameter \alpha is equal to 0.1
-Goal: classify 2-dimensional input vectors such that each neuron in the network should respond only to
     the input vectors occurring in its region"""
